This is a test project aimed to test different JSON RPC Ethereum cloud services with [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js). Read [Habr article](https://habr.com/ru/articles/808111/) (in Russian, but I believe can be autotranslated very well) for details.

To run

- copy `.env.example` into `.env` and modify your API URLs.
